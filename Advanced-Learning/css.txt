                    font-size:25px;
                }

            *Explanation:
                Here, h1 is the selector,
                color and font-size are property with their values.

        (2)Class selector:
            *Syntax:

                    <button class="btn"> //class name ="btn" is a selector we have to style it 
                        Star this Repository
                    </button>
                </section>

//NOTE: (class is equal to dot and ID is equal to #. And the combination of the property and values is known as declaration.)

                    color:blue;
                    font-weight:bold;
